// Sandbox value types backed by host primitives. They live in their own module so both the

// a circular import. All four are opaque runtime values inside a program; when a value crosses
// the sandbox boundary (final result, tool arguments, JSON.stringify) they serialize exactly as
// JSON.stringify would: Date -> ISO string (invalid -> null), RegExp/Map/Set -> {}.

 * forked at call time, and `await` observes that fiber's settlement. Promises are opaque
 * runtime references — `typeof` reports `"object"` (as in real JS), operators reject them, and
 * they cannot cross a data boundary un-awaited (the boundary raises an await-hinting
 * diagnostic instead of serializing `{}`).
